# Quickfra - Raw Journey to MVP

This branch is not a tutorial. It’s a log of technical obstacles and how they got resolved.

| Step | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1. **Study** | Pck a brand‑new tool/tech (e.g., Terraform, OCI, AWS, GCP, Cloudflare API). | Dedicated folder `learning/technology` |
| 2. **Experiment** | Break things in a throw‑away sandbox until it finally works. | Atomic commits (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`) |
| 3. **Record** | 30‑second, no‑edit video clip: problem → solution → commit hash. | Playable video in README.md |
