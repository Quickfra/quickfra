# Quickfra - Learning Resources

This branch is my personal learning repository, where I document my journey of mastering new tools and technologies that i will be using and implementing on Quickfra.

| Step | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1. **Study** | I pick a brand‑new tool/tech (e.g., Terraform, OCI, AWS, GCP, Cloudflare API). | Dedicated learning branch `learning/technology` |
| 2. **Experiment** | I break things in a throw‑away sandbox until it finally works. | Atomic commits (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`) |
| 3. **Record** | 30‑second, no‑edit video clip: problem → solution → commit hash. | Playable video in README.md |
